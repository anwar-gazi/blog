The late medieval timee were of great interest to many people as the foundation of early modern to some extent late modern societal and political
foundations were formed at that times, with some great philosopher and social scientists. After Bakhtiar Khilji's conquest of Bengal, many great philosophers visited the vast
ancient gangatic down plains and lots of them settled. Some of them were full time religious preachers, and most of them were actually social scientists
with some amazing and new concepts for people back then. One of them was Shah Mohsen Aulia.
The backstory of this post was my travel to Anwara in Chittagong. It was a whole day landmark discovery mission with my KPR200.
Started with the Parki Beach where I reached at about 1.30PM and had some biking in the beach wet sands. 
The beach didn't make a favorable impression as my prime expectation of the lore of abandoned ship was no more.
So started riding again and this time destination was the least popular beach at Anwara which is Gahira Beach, with adjacent salten forest, called ParaBon in local tongue.
The path to the Gahira beach was not paved and it was very bumpy, but amazingly scenic. I totally forgot my vow of not picking phone, as I snapped hundreds.
Reached the beach at about 2.30PM. This Gahira beach has adjacent Sangu river mouth. The best thing was that the shoreline was paved with big concrete block for cyclone protection.
At about 4PM, started the return journey. The return path was another than the one in which I came in. This road was well paved with vegetation surrounding. And I got what I have been looking for years,
miles of grassland plains with grazing livestock and local childs playing at some spots. Heaven on Earth!
One interesting thought came to my mind. As the village people live in such scenenic places yet they do not appreciate it, because of the "getting used to" effect. They mostly
cherish the concrete jungle of city life. In contrast, we the people from city, cherish the village life. We spend good deal of resources(money) to visit the scenic villages.
So as default, we all people came from such sceneic villages. Then we stopped appreciating the Almighty Creator for the blessings as we took all of that as granted.
We started to cherish the town life which is full on pleasure by low on peace. So the Almighty took away the blessings and put us into what we wanted for ourselves,
a world of terrible life veiled by pleasure elements.
Anyway, in the way back I wanted to visit the shrine of Mohsen Aulia and the little hills of Anwara adjacent to the cantonement.
Also visited the Karnaphuli Tunnel exit road.
