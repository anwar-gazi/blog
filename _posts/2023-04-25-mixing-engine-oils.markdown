Superstitions promoted by oil manufacturers: "Never mix oils of different brands"!
Read it this way: you bought one pack, you must buy another pack!
Given that you are an experienced biker having good idea of oil grades, you can indeed mix engine oils of different brands keeping the grade right. If you know what you are doing, you can mix oils of different brands and varying grades and types for your tailored need. Just keep an eye over the drain interval and consumption.
So no worries if you tried with different brands and now have remaining few hundred mili-litres in each pack. 
If you're topping up a synthetic with a mineral, you should change it a little earlier than usual.
While the manual may recommend one particular viscosity grade, there is actually a range of acceptable oils. The recommended one is probably the lowest safe grade to use. So you're safer going with a higher viscosity grade. But ultimately, oil is better than no oil. Again, maybe shorten the drain interval for your next change.
In the end of the day,
*** All commercially available motor oils are miscible and compatible ***
