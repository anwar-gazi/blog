BMW! Bungee! Monoshock! Wheel! Relatable?
<br>
Laptop bagged and tied with bungee chord to the bike backseat. Made a countryside eid journey in off-road (supposed to be paved asphalt road in paper, some portions including tunnel access road, albeit the next ctg-coxs alternative expressway!!).
Along with my aggressive riding and typical of Lifan's monoshock, the laptop paid the price.
Couldn't boot, yet I was unfazed. I assumed correctly.
What did I do? <br>
edited the fstab (fedora).
Solution sort of, but now I only have the boot drive. Extended giga storage gone yet it was there, underneath the laptop keyboard.
And there was no precision un-screw set accessible.
"You always fancied salvage build for apocalypse" (its a thing now, a strong community is growing these days), I thought.
I had what I needed at minimum, what was the bare minimum to respawn things, and that is the boot drive.
Days later, and I got a screw driver set. Unlocked the laptop case, "repaired" the HDD, hit boot button.
<br>
Grub Rescue! Now the boot drive is gone! So that was waiting for me? Wow!
<br>
Nothing to panic I used to know. Why grub couldn't see the SSD I didn't now.
<br>
Got to list the drives, I noted not just one, but hundred giga storage of two!
<br>
So,
<br>
I know
<br>
Grub in a sense pranking me,
<br>
bugs that devs failed to see!
<br>
Grub why did you mess with configured boot priority?
<br>
Told bios to reorganize boot list, no serendipity,
<br>
And I got back all storage and booted with serenity!
