We need highways. Transportation efficiency helps growing business. And business is done for people,
not just profit hoarding by sidelining true public benefits. People have all kinds of business, big and small. We need big enterprises and we need competition to facilitate improvements and growth.
But uncontrolled or cut-throat proffit hoarding competition causes greater harm to society by influxing big profit for a small group of people.
We live in a society where empathy is a fundamental driving force. We do not live in jungle where survivle of the fittest is a major game being played.
This makes clear that If we want society as it should be, we should actually work for betterment, not competition which is just a tool for certain scenerios.
In highways, everyone needing a movement or eligible(!) should have rights and facilities to move safely and efficiently.
Now with this being said, do we consider three wheeler and non-engine slow running vehicle as eligible for highway? No, and Yes.
No, vehicles with very large gap in actual transportation power shouldn't be intermixed.
Yes, because we built roads for "us", meaning people.
Did we made highway for the elites? with whose taxes?
Vehicles should be in seperate lane, with lane seperation dictated by vehicle power and safe power output category.
WIth each lane boundary properly seperated to prevent pedestrian trespassing.
