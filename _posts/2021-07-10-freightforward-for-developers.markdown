**We released the freight document generator with GPL-2.0 license.**
<br>
As for most developers and business persons can translate that the software is FOSS; Free and Open Source Software.
Let's talk on the `Open Source` and `Free` nature of the software.
<br>
<br>
Breakdown of GPL-2.0 in short:
* Free for both personal and professional use.
* Source is open, you can modify it to your needs.
* You can distribute the modified code base.
* You must retain the GPL-2.0 license, ie. your re-distribution must have the same license. Thats the commitment to FOSS morale.

<br>
We encourage developers to collaborate as a contributor or work on it independently.
In the field of freight forwarding, there are little FOSS solutions that cover a good deal of operations.
<br>
So our effort is to make a dependable solution when someone looks at the FOSS world for a freight forwarding business solution.
<br>
<br>
For freelancers to independent developers working with freight forwarders, so that they install and customize a system into work without a licensing fee.
