Paid premium for regular oil.
Ravenol PAO base oil, synth. "Fouled" after 2500km only. Fouling: engine oil induced noise and ride quality degradation we experience usually.
At 4000km got 300ml consumption and oil got totally flat! Topped up with Motul7100!
Far worse than what experienced with the Motul Indian batches(which had counterfetit suspicion) from rankon motors. Motul which had zero consumption even at 4000km.
There could be some other variables:
Possible spark plug degradation: Im not sure how this affects oil, anyways last check didn't show any serious decline of plug.
Possible plug seal degradation, but this might be very hard to identify.
Possible oil droplets sweep as for seal or gasket deterioration or rubbery seals solubility, due to a pao base oil. Engine bottom seen to be oily-wet these days.
Possible seals degradation due to previous flush oil use: nope, not likely, as used three semi-synthetic meanwhile after the flush and they didn't show any major issues. Drained previous Eneos synth-blend after 1800km and it still showed in very good condition.
I strongly suspect the Ravenol base oil grows unstable after 2500km, as I seen such with a fellow R15 rider for his YamalubeRS4GP which claimed to be "top of the line" synth!
"top of the line", "superior base oil" ... these terms sound like myths(lies!) these days, promoted by marketing team!
