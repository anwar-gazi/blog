Failure "is" the pillar of success!
<br>
That's true as long as you have some good chance for success!
<br>
That doesn't mean failure guarantees success!
<br>
Success requires working hard,
<br>
but working hard doesn't guarantee success.
<br>
Shouldn't you start racing the proper way?
<br>
You raced, you tried, you completed, and yet you didn't even enlisted before, you just raced elsewhere!
<br>
You ride hard days after days, to get from A to B. But you have the wrong map!
<br>
"Optimum" is a thing remember?
<br>
<br>
Don't be AWL: arrogant, wrong, lazy.
<br>
Someone worthy of telling things once said, "25% are lazy, 10% wrong, 64% just arrogant, and thats why 1% gets it!"
